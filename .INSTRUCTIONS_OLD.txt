There are FOUR demos at the moment:

1. Image recognition

  Just open and run the notebook ImageRecognition.ipynb

2. Rugby

  Every time you create a new server,

  a. Open a terminal
  b. Type: cd ~/workspace/Rugby/
  c. Type: source activate Python2
  d. Type: pip install -r requirements.txt

  There are two demos in Rugby: SummarisePlayers.ipynb and FindPlayers.ipynb.
  They only run in Python2, so make sure the Kernel is set to Python2 in
  the Jupyter notebook menu bar. To change the kernel, go to "Kernel"->"Change Kernel"
  in the menu bar and select the one that has Python2.

  You don't have to repeat these steps next time you're using this same server.
  Just open and run the notebooks. We recommend you keep a demo server running
  to avoid having to repeat these steps.

3. Lens

  Room occupancy from Datasets tab.

4. Customer Intelligence

  Published report from Reports tab. DO NOT RUN THE NOTEBOOK!
