Code for the London Irish notebook 'apps' that form part of the long demo of Sherlock. 

* The apps (widgets) are in notebooks. The supporting functionality are in python modules. 

## Warning

* Notebooks must be run in Jupyter (not JupyterLab) as they currently use javascript widgets which are not supported in the JupyterLab Alpha Preview
